# ADR 001 - GitHub Action TODO Tracker

## Status

Implemented

## Date

2024-12-19

## Context

We need to create a GitHub action that automatically scans codebases for TODO comments and creates GitHub issues to track them. This will help maintain visibility of technical debt and pending work items across open source projects.

The tool should:
- Scan for TODO, todo, and ToDo patterns in code
- Skip .git directory and other irrelevant files
- Create GitHub issues for each TODO found
- Prevent duplicate issue creation
- Work both as a standalone CLI tool and as a GitHub Action
- Use PyGithub for GitHub API integration

## Consequences

### Positive

- Automatic tracking of TODO items prevents them from being forgotten
- Standardized issue creation improves project organization
- Dual-mode operation (CLI + GitHub Action) provides flexibility
- Integration with GitHub issues leverages existing workflow tools

### Negative

- May create noise if there are many existing TODOs
- Requires proper token management for GitHub API access
- Need to handle edge cases like TODO in comments vs strings

## User Stories

As a **project maintainer**, I want to automatically track TODO comments in my codebase so that technical debt doesn't get forgotten.

As a **contributor**, I want TODO comments I add to automatically create trackable issues so that follow-up work is properly managed.

As a **DevOps engineer**, I want to run this tool both locally and in CI/CD pipelines so that TODO tracking can be integrated into existing workflows.

As a **open source maintainer**, I want to prevent duplicate issues for the same TODO so that my issue tracker stays organized.

## Tasks

1. **Project Setup**
   - Create Python project structure (src/, tests/, docs/)
   - Set up requirements.txt with PyGithub dependency
   - Create basic CLI entry point

2. **TODO Scanner Implementation**
   - Implement recursive file scanning with .git directory exclusion
   - Create regex patterns for TODO, todo, ToDo detection
   - Store results with file path and line number information

3. **GitHub Integration**
   - Implement GitHub API client using PyGithub
   - Create standardized issue format with TODO content and location
   - Add duplicate prevention logic using issue titles/labels

4. **CLI Interface**
   - Create command-line interface with argument parsing
   - Support for repository path, GitHub token, and repository specification
   - Add dry-run mode for testing

5. **GitHub Action Wrapper**
   - Create action.yml file with input definitions
   - Implement action wrapper script
   - Add proper error handling and logging

6. **Testing & Documentation**
   - Write unit tests with pytest
   - Create integration tests
   - Document usage in README.md
